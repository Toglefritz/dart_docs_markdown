# Overview for `MarkdownGenerator`

## Description

A utility class for generating Markdown documentation for Dart/Flutter projects.

 The [MarkdownGenerator] class is responsible for creating a structured set of Markdown documents
 from parsed Dart file data. This is particularly useful for projects integrating with Markdown-based
 documentation sites such as Docusaurus, enabling a clear, navigable documentation structure.

 ### Purpose
 This class processes a parsed representation of Dart files ([DartFileData]), extracting information
 about classes, their members, constructors, and methods, as well as global functions and variables.
 It then generates corresponding Markdown files with detailed documentation for each entity. The
 resulting output is organized into a directory structure designed to facilitate easy navigation
 and integration with a documentation site.

 ### Process
 The Markdown generation process follows these steps:
 1. **Traverse Classes**: For each class in a Dart file:
    - Create an overview document containing:
      - The class name and its Dartdoc comments.
      - A list of dependencies (e.g., superclasses, mixins, interfaces).
      - A list of all class members, including:
        - Unnamed and factory constructors.
        - Fields and their associated documentation.
    - Create a folder named after the class, containing a subfolder (`methods/`) where
      each method (public or private) has its own Markdown document. These documents include:
      - The method name and Dartdoc comments.
      - Details about its parameters, return type, and any exceptions thrown.
 2. **Document Global Functions and Variables**:
    - Generate a single `global_functions.md` file at the root of the output directory.
    - This file contains details for all global functions and variables in the Dart file,
      including their names, Dartdoc comments, parameters, and return types.

 ### Output Directory Structure
 For a Dart file named `example.dart`, the following directory structure is generated:

 ```plaintext
 output/
 └── example/
     ├── ClassName/
     │   ├── overview.md        // Documentation for the class, including members and constructors.
     │   └── methods/
     │       ├── method1.md     // Documentation for a specific method.
     │       ├── method2.md
     │       └── ...
     └── global_functions.md   // Documentation for global functions and variables in the file.
 ```

 ### Integration with Documentation Sites
 The generated Markdown files are designed for compatibility with Markdown-based documentation
 platforms like Docusaurus. Each class and method is documented in a modular fashion, enabling
 easy linking and navigation within a documentation site.

 This class ensures that the documentation generated is comprehensive, readable, and easy to navigate.
