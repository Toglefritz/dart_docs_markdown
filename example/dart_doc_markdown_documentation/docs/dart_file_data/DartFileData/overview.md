# Overview for `DartFileData`

## Description

Represents the parsed content of a Dart file, including its classes and global functions.

 **Purpose in the CLI Tool:**
 The `DartFileData` class serves as a data container for storing metadata about Dart files analyzed by the CLI tool.
 It encapsulates all relevant information about the classes and global functions defined in a Dart file, allowing
 the tool to generate structured Markdown documentation for each file.

 **How It Works:**
 - During the parsing phase, the `DartParser` class analyzes a Dart file and creates a `DartFileData` object for
   each file.
 - The `DartFileData` object stores a list of `ClassData` objects, which represent the classes in the file, and
   `FunctionData` objects, which represent global functions and variables.
 - This data is then passed to the `MarkdownGenerator`, which uses it to produce Markdown documentation for the
   file's contents.

 **Responsibilities:**
 The primary responsibilities of the `DartFileData` class are:
 - **File Path Storage:**
   Store the path of the Dart file being analyzed, enabling traceability and debugging during
   the documentation generation process.
 - **Class Storage:**
   Maintain a list of `ClassData` objects representing the classes defined in the Dart file.
 - **Global Function Storage:**
   Maintain a list of `FunctionData` objects representing the global functions and variables
   defined in the Dart file.

 **Fields:**
 - `filePath`:
   The path of the Dart file being analyzed. This field provides context for where the parsed
   content originated.
 - `classes`:
   A list of `ClassData` objects, each representing a class defined in the Dart file. These
   objects include metadata about the class, such as its name, methods, constructors, and fields.
 - `globalFunctions`:
   A list of `FunctionData` objects, each representing a global function or variable defined in
   the Dart file. These objects include metadata such as the function's name, return type, parameters,
   and Dartdoc comments.

 **Usage in Markdown Generation:**
 The `MarkdownGenerator` class uses `DartFileData` to:
 - Generate a class-specific folder containing an overview and method-specific Markdown documents.
 - Generate a `global_functions.md` file to document all global functions and variables in the file.

 **Integration with Parsing:**
 The `DartParser` class creates and populates the `DartFileData` object during its traversal of
 the Dart Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This ensures that the data is comprehensive and ready for
 Markdown generation.

## Members

- **filePath**: `String`
  The path of the Dart file.

- **classes**: `List<ClassData>`
  List of classes found in the file.

- **globalFunctions**: `List<FunctionData>`
  List of global functions found in the file.

## Constructors

### Unnamed Constructor
Constructor to initialize the file path.
