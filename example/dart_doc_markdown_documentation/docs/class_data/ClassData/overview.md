# Overview for `ClassData`

## Description

Represents the parsed data for a Dart class, including its members, methods, constructors, and dependencies.

 The [ClassData] class serves as a container for all the metadata extracted from a Dart class during the parsing
 phase of the CLI tool. It is designed to store a detailed representation of a Dart class and its associated elements,
 enabling the generation of Markdown documentation for each class in a structured and modular format.

 **Purpose in the CLI Tool:**
 The `ClassData` class is a core component in the overall architecture of the CLI tool. It provides a way to
 encapsulate all relevant information about a Dart class, which is later used to generate documentation files. This
 ensures that the documentation for each class is both comprehensive and easy to navigate when integrated into
 Markdown-based documentation platforms like Docusaurus.

 **Responsibilities:**
 - **Store Class Metadata**:
   - The name of the class.
   - The Dartdoc comment for the class, if any.

 - **Capture Class Members**:
   - Fields (member variables) and their metadata, such as name, type, and Dartdoc comment.

 - **Document Class Methods**:
   - Methods, including their names, Dartdoc comments, parameters, return types, and visibility.

 - **Record Constructors**:
   - Unnamed and factory constructors, with their associated parameters and documentation.

 - **Track Dependencies**:
   - Superclasses, mixins, and interfaces that the class depends on.

 **Usage in the Markdown Generation Process:**
 During the parsing phase:
 1. The `DartParser` class extracts information from Dart classes in the source code.
 2. For each class encountered, a `ClassData` object is created and populated with metadata for
    fields, methods, constructors, and dependencies.

 During the Markdown generation phase:
 1. The `MarkdownGenerator` uses the `ClassData` object to create:
    - An `overview.md` document for the class, summarizing its metadata.
    - Individual documentation files for each method, placed in a dedicated folder.

 **Fields:**
 - **`name`**: The name of the class.
 - **`documentation`**: The Dartdoc comment associated with the class.
 - **`fields`**: A list of fields (member variables) belonging to the class.
 - **`methods`**: A list of methods defined in the class.
 - **`constructors`**: A list of constructors, including unnamed and factory constructors.
 - **`dependencies`**: A list of dependencies, such as superclass, mixins, and interfaces.

 This class is central to the CLI tool's ability to process and document Dart classes effectively.

## Members

- **name**: `String`
  The name of the class.

- **documentation**: `String?`
  The documentation comment for the class, if any.

- **fields**: `List<FieldData>`
  A list of fields (member variables) belonging to the class.

- **methods**: `List<MethodData>`
  List of methods belonging to the class.

- **constructors**: `List<ConstructorData>`
  List of constructors belonging to the class.

- **dependencies**: `List<String>`
  List of dependencies (superclasses, mixins, or interfaces) for the class.

## Constructors

### Unnamed Constructor
Constructor to initialize the class data.
