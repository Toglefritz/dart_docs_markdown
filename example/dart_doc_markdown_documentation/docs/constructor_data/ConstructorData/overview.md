# Overview for `ConstructorData`

## Description

Represents metadata for a Dart constructor, including its name, documentation, and parameters.

 **Purpose in the CLI Tool:**
 The `ConstructorData` class is a critical component of the CLI tool's architecture. It serves as a data structure
 for capturing all relevant details about constructors in Dart classes, extracted during the parsing phase. This
 information is subsequently used to generate Markdown documentation for each class, ensuring that constructors are
 accurately documented along with their associated parameters and descriptions.

 **How It Works:**
 - The `DartParser` class uses the `_extractConstructorData` method to populate instances of `ConstructorData` by
 traversing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a Dart file.
 - Each `ConstructorData` object encapsulates the following details:
   - The name of the constructor.
   - The Dartdoc comment associated with the constructor, if any.
   - A list of parameters defined in the constructor, stored as `ParameterData` objects.
   - A flag (`isUnnamedConstructor`) to indicate whether the constructor is unnamed.

 **Responsibilities:**
 The primary responsibilities of the `ConstructorData` class are:
 - **Encapsulation:**
   Provide a structured way to store all information about a single constructor, ensuring that the
   data can be easily accessed during Markdown generation.
 - **Integration:**
   Serve as part of the `ClassData` object, allowing the CLI tool to generate comprehensive class
   documentation, including details about all constructors.
 - **Support for Markdown Generation:**
   Enable the `MarkdownGenerator` class to include constructors in the `overview.md` file for
   each class, listing their names, documentation, and parameters.

 **Fields:**
 - `name`: The name of the constructor, as extracted from the Dart code. If the constructor is unnamed, this will
    typically be a default placeholder or empty string.
 - `documentation`: The Dartdoc comment associated with the constructor, used to provide descriptive information in
    the generated documentation.
 - `parameters`: A list of `ParameterData` objects, each representing a parameter defined in the constructor,
    including its name, type, and additional metadata.
 - `isUnnamedConstructor`: A boolean flag indicating whether the constructor is unnamed. This is particularly useful
    for distinguishing default constructors from named or factory ones.

 **Usage in Markdown Generation:**
 The `MarkdownGenerator` class uses `ConstructorData` objects to include detailed constructor documentation in class
 overview files. For example:
 - The constructor's name is displayed as a section header.
 - The Dartdoc comment is included as a description beneath the header.
 - Parameters are listed in a structured format, showing their names and types.

## Members

- **name**: `String`
  The name of the constructor.

- **documentation**: `String?`
  The documentation comment for the constructor, if any.

- **parameters**: `List<ParameterData>`
  List of parameters for the constructor.

- **isUnnamedConstructor**: `bool`
  Determines if the constructor is unnamed.

## Constructors

### Unnamed Constructor
Constructor to initialize the constructor data.
