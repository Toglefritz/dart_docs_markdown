# Dart Docs Markdown

**Dart Docs Markdown** is a CLI tool that generates Markdown documentation for Dart/Flutter
projects. The tool is designed to provide an easy way to integrate your code documentation into
systems like Docusaurus, GitBook, or other documentation platforms that support Markdown files.

## Overview

This tool traverses the directory structure of a Dart/Flutter project, analyzes its files, and
generates Markdown documentation for classes, methods, and other code elements. The output is
formatted for use in documentation systems, making it ideal for teams that manage developer or
project documentation in platforms designed for Markdown.

## Use Case

The primary use case for **Dart Docs Markdown** is to bridge the gap between traditional code
documentation tools and modern documentation systems. By generating Markdown files, this tool
enables developers to:

- Integrate code documentation into platforms like **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**,
  **[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)**, or **[ReadMe](https://readme.com/)**.
- Maintain code documentation alongside other project documentation.
- Customize and enhance documentation workflows with Markdown-based systems.

## How This Tool Differs from Dartdoc

The `dartdoc` package and **Dart Docs Markdown** serve different purposes:

### Dartdoc

- **Output Format**: Generates static HTML files.
- **Use Case**: Creates a self-contained documentation site that can be hosted directly on a server.
- **Deployment**: Suitable for teams that want a standalone documentation site without external
  integration.

### Dart Docs Markdown

- **Output Format**: Generates Markdown files.
- **Use Case**: Designed for integration into documentation systems like:
    - **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)**
    - **[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)**
    - **[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)**
    - **[ReadMe](https://readme.com/)**
- **Deployment**: Ideal for teams already using systems that support Markdown to manage
  documentation.

If you need a standalone documentation site, `dartdoc` is the better choice. If you need
documentation that integrates with other tools and workflows, **Dart Docs Markdown** is the right
solution.

## Importance of Dartdoc Comments

The quality of the documentation Markdown files generated by this CLI tool is heavily dependent on
the **Dartdoc comments** included in your Dart/Flutter project. Much of the content in the Markdown
files comes directly from the Dartdoc comments on classes, methods, constructors, and fields in your
codebase.

### Why Dartdoc Comments Matter

Without comprehensive and well-written Dartdoc comments:

- The generated documentation will lack detailed descriptions and explanations.
- Key information about the purpose of classes, methods, or fields may be missing.
- Users of the documentation may find it difficult to understand the intent and functionality of
  your code.

Conversely, well-maintained Dartdoc comments ensure:

- High-quality, professional Markdown documentation.
- Clear explanations of your codebase, enhancing collaboration and usability.
- A consistent and complete representation of your project's functionality.

### Best Practices for Writing Dartdoc Comments

To maximize the quality of the generated documentation, follow these best practices:

1. **Use Dartdoc Syntax**: Write comments using the triple slash (`///`) syntax above classes,
   methods, constructors, and fields.
2. **Be Descriptive**: Include detailed information about the purpose, parameters, and return values
   for methods and constructors.
3. **Document Parameters and Return Types**:
   ```dart
   /// Adds two numbers together.
   ///
   /// [a]: The first number.
   /// [b]: The second number.
   /// Returns the sum of [a] and [b].
   int add(int a, int b) => a + b;

## Installation

Install the tool by activating the global executable:

```bash
# Install globally
dart pub global activate dart_doc_markdown_generator
```

## Usage

### Generate Markdown Documentation

To generate Markdown documentation for your project:

1. Run the CLI tool with the required arguments:

```bash
dart run dart_doc_markdown_generator <project_directory> <output_directory>
```

- **`<project_directory>`**: The root directory of your Dart/Flutter project.
- **`<output_directory>`**: The directory where the generated Markdown files will be stored.

Example:

```bash
dart run dart_docs_markdown ./my_flutter_project ./docs
```

This command scans the `my_flutter_project` directory and generates Markdown documentation in the
`docs` folder.

### Example Output

After running the tool, the `docs` directory will contain:

```
docs/
├── lib-main.md
├── lib-auth-service.md
└── lib-ui-components.md
```

Each Markdown file represents a Dart file in your project, containing:

- Classes and their descriptions
- Methods with parameter and return type information
- Any Dartdoc comments present in the source code

### Customize Configuration

You can configure the tool using a `.dartdocmarkdownrc` file (optional) to specify:

- Files or directories to ignore
- Formatting preferences
- Custom output paths
